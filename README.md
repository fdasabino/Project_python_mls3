# Nasa vs Aliens - Spaceship Game

## Project Goals

-   The main goal with this project is demonstrate the power of python programing language, and how simple it is to implement a
    basic application concept.

-   Nasa vs Aliens is a game developed to bring back the nostalgia of the 80s and 90s 2d games. This application target is mostly
    people that enjoy a good, light old fashioned game to pass the time or simply for the act of socializing.

Visible through out each match, shows players the status of their ship. Each player has 10 life points,
whenever a player reaches 0 the game is restarted.

#### Two Player Game

Players can share the same keyboard in order to play a match.

1. The left player uses the following keys:

-   UP --> W
-   DOWN --> S
-   LEFT --> A
-   RIGHT --> D
-   SHOOT --> SPACE-BAR

2. The right player uses the following keys:

-   UP --> ARROW UP
-   DOWN --> ARROW DOWN
-   LEFT --> ARROW LEFT
-   RIGHT --> ARROW RIGHT
-   SHOOT --> RIGHT CTRL

#### Features Left to Implement

1. In a near future I would like to implement a intro that presents the game.
2. Add a menu that let players choose their game character.

## User Experience

### Users can

Enjoy a simple and easy to run command line application that can be played by two players on the same keyboard simultaneously.
The game can also played by one player using both hands to challenge their keyboard skills.

### First Time Visitor Goals

As a first time visitor, I would like to play a fun game that brings out the simplicity of old school games, on a modern platform.

### Returning Visitor Goals

As a returning user I would like to have the application deployed and easy to access, so I can play the game with friends and family.

## Design & Imagery

As part of the design of the application Python allows you create global variables using color palettes and images.

The bullets fired by the ships and main border are created by a pygame module called (Rect).
