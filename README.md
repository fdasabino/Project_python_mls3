# Nasa vs Aliens - Spaceship Game

## Project Goals

-   The main goal with this project is demonstrate the power of python programing language, and how simple it is to implement a
    basic application concept.

-   Nasa vs Aliens is a game developed to bring back the nostalgia of the 80s and 90s 2d games. This application target is mostly
    people that enjoy a good, light old fashioned game to pass the time or simply for the act of socializing.
